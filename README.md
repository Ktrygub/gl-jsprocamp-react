bugs / todos :

- [ ] need to add some notification when user trying to add already added movie ( current behaviour: just nothing happend, no duplicate movie added with no notification)

- [ ] broken 'stars rating' css representation when we manually changing it inside AddMovieForm or DetailsPage (when we change rating and press 'discard' button). Rating logic is fine but css representation is broken

- [x] add confirmation dialog after user press 'delete film' button
