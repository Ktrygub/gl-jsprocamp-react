## MovieDB app

[Website](https://ktrygub.github.io/gl-jsprocamp-react/)

## Description:
 
 MovieDB is an application where you can store your own favorite movies.
 
 You can add, rate, edit and delete your favorite movies. 
 
 You can search through or sort your favorite movies by title, description, genre, actors, release year etc.
 
 All movies are stored in browser local storage.


## known bugs / todos :
- [ ] add some notification when user trying to add already existing movie ( current behavior: nothing happens, no duplicate movie added with no notification)
- [ ] broken 'stars rating' CSS representation when manually changing movie rating inside 'Add Movie' form or 'Movie Details' page (when we change rating and press 'discard' button). Rating logic is fine but CSS representation is broken.
- [ ] group / reorganize movies order (drag'n'drop, groups structure etc.)
- [x] add confirmation dialog after user pressed 'delete movie' button
